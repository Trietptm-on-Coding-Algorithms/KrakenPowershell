Powershell script for making life easier when working with Hashcat

Things needed to make this work.  Needs to be located in the Hashcat folder where the executable and rules live.  Also needs to have a WordList folder one directory up in order to populate the different wordlist attacks.  If you aren't using the Wordlist attacks you could just comment out the Folder check.  

## Progression of script: 
1. Prompt for input file with dialog box
2. Prompt for company code
3. Prompt for Hash Mode
4. Short Description of Different Attack Modes
5. Prompt for Attack Type [Default BruteForce]

## ToDo 
- [ ] Finish up testing with a variety of different files and attack modes.
- [ ] Error Checking
